# Virtual Mouse Using MediaPipe and OpenCV

This project implements a **virtual mouse system** that allows users to control mouse functions using hand gestures. It utilizes **MediaPipe** for real-time hand tracking and **OpenCV** for computer vision to capture and process hand movements through a webcam. The system offers touch-free interaction for common mouse functions such as cursor movement, clicking, and scrolling.

## Features

- **Cursor Movement**: Control the cursor by tracking fingertip movements in real-time.
- **Clicking**: Perform left-click and right-click actions using specific hand gestures.
- **Scrolling**: Scroll up and down by adjusting hand movement along the y-axis.
- **Touchless Interaction**: Fully hands-free control, enhancing hygiene and convenience.

## Technologies Used

- **MediaPipe**: For hand gesture recognition and tracking.
- **OpenCV**: For capturing video feed and image processing.
- **Python**: The core programming language for building the system.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtual-mouse-mediapipe-opencv.git
   cd virtual-mouse-mediapipe-opencv
